# RTL to GDSII Flow 🚀

This repository demonstrates the **RTL to GDSII flow** in ASIC design, starting from Verilog RTL and progressing through synthesis, floorplanning, placement, CTS, routing, and signoff. The final output is a **GDSII layout** ready for fabrication, using open-source or industry-standard tools.

---

## 📌 Overview
The **RTL to GDSII flow** is the standard VLSI backend design process. It systematically converts a high-level RTL design into a manufacturable physical layout while meeting power, performance, and area (PPA) requirements.

---

## ⚙️ Flow Stages
1. **RTL Design** – HDL coding and functional verification  
2. **Synthesis** – RTL → gate-level netlist optimization  
3. **DFT** – Insert scan chains & test structures  
4. **Floorplanning** – Chip size, I/O, macro, and power planning  
5. **Placement** – Place standard cells and optimize congestion  
6. **CTS** – Build clock tree with controlled skew & latency  
7. **Routing** – Global & detailed routing, DRC clean  
8. **Signoff** – STA, power analysis, DRC, LVS checks  
9. **GDSII Generation** – Final tape-out database  

---

## 🛠️ Tools
- **Synthesis**: Yosys / Design Compiler  
- **PnR**: OpenROAD, Innovus, ICC2  
- **Timing Analysis**: OpenSTA, PrimeTime  
- **Verification**: Icarus Verilog, ModelSim  
- **DRC/LVS**: Magic, Calibre
