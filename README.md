# Physical-Design-Implementation
This repository demonstrates the RTL to GDSII flow in ASIC design, starting from Verilog RTL and progressing through synthesis, floorplanning, placement, CTS, routing, and signoff. The final output is a GDSII layout ready for fabrication, using open-source or industry-standard tools.
